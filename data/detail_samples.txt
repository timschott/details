be a blank space of delightful mystery—a white patch for a boy to dream gloriously over. it had become a place of darkness. but there was in it one river especially, a mighty big river, that you could see on the map, resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country, and its tail lost in the depths of the land. and as i looked at the map of it in a shop-window, it fascinated me as a snake would a bird—a silly little bird. then i remembered there was a big concern, a company for trade on that river. dash it all! i thought to myself, they can’t trade without using some kind of craft on that lot of fresh water—steamboats! why shouldn’t i try to get charge of one? i went on along fleet street, but could not shake off the idea.
suppose they might have consciences that told them how surely they were making the old mother into an advocate for them, in case they had any plans on the son’s heart.” she smiled a grim smile, for she had been pleased by margaret’s frankness; and perhaps she felt that she had been asking questions too much as if she had a right to catechise. margaret laughed outright at the notion presented to her; laughed so merrily that it grated on mrs. thornton’s ear, as if the words that called forth that laugh, must have been utterly and entirely ludicrous. margaret stopped her merriment as soon as she saw mrs. thornton’s annoyed look. “i beg your pardon, madam. but i really am very much obliged to you for exonerating me from making any plans on mr. thornton’s heart.” “young ladies have, before
straggling stalks, which proved to be stalks of rice, and which i knew, because i had seen it grow in africa when i was ashore there. i not only thought these the pure productions of providence for my support, but not doubting that there was more in the place, i went all over that part of the island, where i had been before, peering in every corner, and under every rock, to see for more of it, but i could not find any. at last it occurred to my thoughts that i shook a bag of chickens’ meat out in that place; and then the wonder began to cease; and i must confess my religious thankfulness to god’s providence began to abate, too, upon the discovering that all this was nothing but what was common; though i ought to have been as thankful for so strange and unforeseen a providence as if it
wore away; of looking in this impossible place and that; of groping among moonlit ruins and touching strange creatures in the black shadows; at last, of lying on the ground near the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness, even anger at the folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength. i had nothing left but misery. then i slept, and when i woke again it was full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf within reach of my arm. “i sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how i had got there, and why i had such a profound sense of desertion and despair. then things came clear in my mind. with the plain, reasonable daylight, i could look my circumstances fairly in the face. i saw the wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and i
to go to town once a week to see her lover. at the end of a month she was even considered to have made considerable progress. she went on thursdays. she got up and dressed silently, in order not to awaken charles, who would have made remarks about her getting ready too early. next she walked up and down, went to the windows, and looked out at the place. the early dawn was broadening between the pillars of the market, and the chemist’s shop, with the shutters still up, showed in the pale light of the dawn the large letters of his signboard. when the clock pointed to a quarter past seven, she went off to the “lion d’or,” whose door artémise opened yawning. the girl then made up the coals covered by the cinders, and emma remained alone in the kitchen. now and again she went out. hivert was
lost in all sorts of conjectures, accusing him of indifference, and reproaching herself for her weakness, she spent the afternoon, her face pressed against the window-panes. at two o’clock they were still at a table opposite each other. the large room was emptying; the stove-pipe, in the shape of a palm-tree, spread its gilt leaves over the white ceiling, and near them, outside the window, in the bright sunshine, a little fountain gurgled in a white basin, where; in the midst of watercress and asparagus, three torpid lobsters stretched across to some quails that lay heaped up in a pile on their sides. homais was enjoying himself. although he was even more intoxicated with the luxury than the rich fare, the pommard wine all the same rather excited his faculties; and when the omelette

to delay him, with his habitual tranquillity. he never changed countenance for an instant, though a delay of twenty hours, by making him too late for the yokohama boat, would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager. but this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme, and had been foreseen. aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him. fix did not look at the state of things in the same light. the storm greatly pleased him. his satisfaction would have been complete had the “rangoon” been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves. each delay filled him with hope, for it became more and more probable that fogg would be obliged to remain some days at hong
old housekeeper at chesney wold, has several times taken off her spectacles and cleaned them to make certain that the drops were not upon the glasses. mrs. rouncewell might have been sufficiently assured by hearing the rain, but that she is rather deaf, which nothing will induce her to believe. she is a fine old lady, handsome, stately, wonderfully neat, and has such a back and such a stomacher that if her stays should turn out when she dies to have been a broad old-fashioned family fire-grate, nobody who knows her would have cause to be surprised. weather affects mrs. rouncewell little. the house is there in all weathers, and the house, as she expresses it, is what she looks at. she sits in her room (in a side passage on the ground floor, with an arched window commanding a smooth qua
entered her mind of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any inquiry of marianne. nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than willoughby’s behaviour. to marianne it had all the distinguishing tenderness which a lover’s heart could give, and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother. the cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home; many more of his hours were spent there than at allenham; and if no general engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of marianne, and by his favourite pointer at her feet. one evening in particular,
something far more serious than could be guessed at first sight. as soon as porfiry petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter of business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down himself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such exceptional solemnity. but in brief and coherent phrases raskolnikov explained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at porfiry. porfiry petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. razumihin, sitting opposite at the same

of mountains about two thousand feet high, the shapes of which were most capricious. on taking the bearings, i knew that we were nearing the island of ceylon, the pearl which hangs from the lobe of the indian peninsula. captain nemo and his second appeared at this moment. the captain glanced at the map. then turning to me, said: the island of ceylon, noted for its pearl-fisheries. would you like to visit one of them, m. aronnax? certainly, captain. well, the thing is easy. though, if we see the fisheries, we shall not see the fishermen. the annual exportation has not yet begun. never mind, i will give orders to make for the gulf of manaar, where we shall arrive in the night. the captain said something to his second, who immediately went out. soon the nautilus returned to her
and a vast length of time to bring it to any sort of perfection. the former of these, the immense wealth of which the captain supposed mr allworthy possessed, and which he thought himself sure of inheriting, promised very effectually to supply; and the latter, the soundness of his own constitution, and his time of life, which was only what is called middle-age, removed all apprehension of his not living to accomplish. nothing was wanting to enable him to enter upon the immediate execution of this plan, but the death of mr allworthy; in calculating which he had employed much of his own algebra, besides purchasing every book extant that treats of the value of lives, reversions, &c. from all which he satisfied himself, that as he had every day a chance of this happening, so had he more
doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to elinor, her conviction of her sister’s danger would not allow her to offer the comfort of hope. her heart was really grieved. the rapid decay, the early death of a girl so young, so lovely as marianne, must have struck a less interested person with concern. on mrs. jennings’s compassion she had other claims. she had been for three months her companion, was still under her care, and she was known to have been greatly injured, and long unhappy. the distress of her sister too, particularly a favourite, was before her;—and as for their mother, when mrs. jennings considered that marianne might probably be to _her_ what charlotte was to herself, her sympathy in _her_ sufferings was very sincere. mr. harris was punctual in his second visit
joseph! quick with the prints—lot 235. now, gentlemen, you who are connoiss_ures_, you are going to have a treat. here is an engraving of the duke of wellington surrounded by his staff on the field of waterloo; and notwithstanding recent events which have, as it were, enveloped our great hero in a cloud, i will be bold to say—for a man in my line must not be blown about by political winds—that a finer subject—of the modern order, belonging to our own time and epoch—the understanding of man could hardly conceive: angels might, perhaps, but not men, sirs, not men.” “who painted it?” said mr. powderell, much impressed. “it is a proof before the letter, mr. powderell—the painter is not known,” answered trumbull, with a certain gaspingness in his last words, after which he pursed up his lip
gesture, so discouraged was he at this two-fold obstinacy of gossip and indifference. the everlasting guide went on-- “near him, this kneeling woman who weeps is his spouse, diane de poitiers, countess de breze, duchess de valentinois, born in 1499, died in 1566, and to the left, the one with the child is the holy virgin. now turn to this side; here are the tombs of the ambroise. they were both cardinals and archbishops of rouen. that one was minister under louis xii. he did a great deal for the cathedral. in his will he left thirty thousand gold crowns for the poor.” and without stopping, still talking, he pushed them into a chapel full of balustrades, some put away, and disclosed a kind of block that certainly might once have been an ill-made statue. “truly,” he said with a groan, “it

the unhappy man would be cut in two. i rushed to his succour. but captain nemo was before me; his axe disappeared between the two enormous jaws, and, miraculously saved, the canadian, rising, plunged his harpoon deep into the triple heart of the poulp. i owed myself this revenge! said the captain to the canadian. ned bowed without replying. the combat had lasted a quarter of an hour. the monsters, vanquished and mutilated, left us at last, and disappeared under the waves. captain nemo, covered with blood, nearly exhausted, gazed upon the sea that had swallowed up one of his companions, and great tears gathered in his eyes. the gulf stream this terrible scene of the 20th of april none of us can ever forget. i have written it under the influence of violent emotion. since then i have

calling her an old jade, and threatening that he would soon return. at the foot of the staircase, he took one of the men who accompanied him, a navvy named cassoute, the most wooden-headed of the four, and ordered him to sit on the first step, and remain there. “you must come and inform me,” he said to him, “if you see the scoundrel from upstairs return.” the man sat down heavily. when macquart reached the pavement, he raised his eyes and observed félicité leaning out of the window of the yellow-drawing room, watching the march past of the insurgents, as if it was nothing but a regiment passing through the town to the strains of its band. this last sign of perfect composure irritated him to such a degree that he was almost tempted to go up again and throw the old woman into the
moment george f. babbitt turned ponderously in bed--the last turn, signifying that he'd had enough of this worried business of falling asleep and was about it in earnest. instantly he was in the magic dream. he was somewhere among unknown people who laughed at him. he slipped away, ran down the paths of a midnight garden, and at the gate the fairy child was waiting. her dear and tranquil hand caressed his cheek. he was gallant and wise and well-beloved; warm ivory were her arms; and beyond perilous moors the brave sea glittered. i the great events of babbitt's spring were the secret buying of real-estate options in linton for certain street-traction officials, before the public announcement that the linton avenue car line would be extended, and a dinner which was, as he rejoiced to his

to minute down the days of the month on which any remarkable thing happened to me; and first, by casting up times past, i remembered that there was a strange concurrence of days in the various providences which befell me, and which, if i had been superstitiously inclined to observe days as fatal or fortunate, i might have had reason to have looked upon with a great deal of curiosity. first, i had observed that the same day that i broke away from my father and friends and ran away to hull, in order to go to sea, the same day afterwards i was taken by the sallee man-of-war, and made a slave; the same day of the year that i escaped out of the wreck of that ship in yarmouth roads, that same day-year afterwards i made my escape from sallee in a boat; the same day of the year i was born
at once, anxious to live in the settlement with the idea of being nearer to his mates. the matter was settled in three words, maheude declaring that they would wait for the marriage of the children. just then, zacharie at last came back, with mouquet and levaque. the three brought in the odours of the volcan, a breath of gin, a musky acidity of ill-kept girls. they were very tipsy and seemed well pleased with themselves, digging their elbows into each other and grinning. when he knew that he was at last to be married zacharie began to laugh so loudly that he choked. philoméne peacefully declared that she would rather see him laugh than cry. as there were no more chairs, bouteloup had moved so as to give up half of his to levaque. and the latter, suddenly much affected by realizing

hidden behind a shed. he himself fastened his horse, which a lad had been holding, beneath the shed. when he came back he found his aunt and the young girls distracted, and ready to follow the peasant-woman, who proposed that they should take refuge in her house. but he was of opinion that they would be safer where they were, for certainly no one would come and look for them in the hay. the door, however, shut very badly, and had such large chinks in it, that the road could be seen between the worm-eaten planks. come, courage! he said. we will sell our lives dearly. this joke increased their fear. the noise grew louder, but nothing could yet be seen; along the vacant road the wind of a tempest seemed to be blowing, like those sudden gusts which precede great storms. no, no! i
throw one last glance into the darkness. he saw again the same black immensity as in the morning when he had arrived in the wind. before him the voreux was crouching, with its air of an evil beast, its dimness pricked with a few lantern lights. the three braziers of the bank were burning in the air, like bloody moons, now and then showing the vast silhouettes of father bonnemort and his yellow horse. and beyond, in the flat plain, shade had submerged everything, montsou, marchiennes, the forest of vandame, the immense sea of beetroot and of wheat, in which there only shone, like distant lighthouses, the blue fires of the blast furnaces, and the red fires of the coke ovens. gradually the night came on, the rain was now falling slowly, continuously, burying this void in its monotonous stre
certain that, if there were a remedy, it should be found and secured to her. several weeks had elapsed since the festival of the anniversary, and she had been unable to calm her mind, or to subdue her thoughts to any regular train. sometimes she reproached herself for taking too bitterly to heart, that which many would esteem an imaginary evil; but this was no subject for reason; and, ignorant as she was of the motives and true conduct of raymond, things assumed for her even a worse appearance, than the reality warranted. he was seldom at the palace; never, but when he was assured that his public duties would prevent his remaining alone with perdita. they seldom addressed each other, shunning explanation, each fearing any communication the other might make. suddenly, however, the manner

another turn of the screw would kill him, little stanislovas stopped. “you cannot help us?” he said weakly. jurgis shook his head. “they won’t give you anything here?” he shook it again. “when are you coming out?” “three weeks yet,” jurgis answered. and the boy gazed around him uncertainly. “then i might as well go,” he said. jurgis nodded. then, suddenly recollecting, he put his hand into his pocket and drew it out, shaking. “here,” he said, holding out the fourteen cents. “take this to them.” and stanislovas took it, and after a little more hesitation, started for the door. “good-by, jurgis,” he said, and the other noticed that he walked unsteadily as he passed out of sight. for a minute or so jurgis stood clinging to his chair, reeling and swaying; then the keeper touched him on the

these young lovers to retire to secluded spots in the suburbs. on fine summer nights one cannot walk round plassans without coming across a hooded couple in every patch of shadow falling from the house walls. certain places, the aire saint-mittre, for instance, are full of these dark “dominoes” brushing past one another, gliding softly in the warm nocturnal air. one might imagine they were guests invited to some mysterious ball given by the stars to lowly lovers. when the weather is very warm and the girls do not wear cloaks, they simply turn up their over-skirts. and in the winter the more passionate lovers make light of the frosts. thus, miette and silvère, as they descended the nice road, thought little of the chill december night. they passed through the slumbering suburb

to be at the station promptly at eight, and, with his regular step, which beat to the second, like an astronomical clock, directed his steps to the passport office. as for the wonders of bombay—its famous city hall, its splendid library, its forts and docks, its bazaars, mosques, synagogues, its armenian churches, and the noble pagoda on malabar hill, with its two polygonal towers—he cared not a straw to see them. he would not deign to examine even the masterpieces of elephanta, or the mysterious hypogea, concealed south-east from the docks, or those fine remains of buddhist architecture, the kanherian grottoes of the island of salcette. having transacted his business at the passport office, phileas fogg repaired quietly to the railway station, where he ordered dinner. among the dishes
there were no hedges, no signs of proprietary rights, no evidences of agriculture; the whole earth had become a garden. “so watching, i began to put my interpretation upon the things i had seen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation was something in this way. (afterwards i found i had got only a half truth—or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.) “it seemed to me that i had happened upon humanity upon the wane. the ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. for the first time i began to realise an odd consequence of the social effort in which we are at present engaged. and yet, come to think, it is a logical consequence enough. strength is the outcome of need; security sets a premium on feebleness. the work of ameliorating the conditions of

you, mr. gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame—” “stop!” faltered dorian gray, “stop! you bewilder me. i don’t know what to say. there is some answer to you, but i cannot find it. don’t speak. let me think. or, rather, let me try not to think.” for nearly ten minutes he stood there, motionless, with parted lips and eyes strangely bright. he was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him. yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself. the few words that basil’s friend had said to him—words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox
purpose of selling--not of selling anything in particular, for or to anybody in particular, but pure selling. the shop-talk roused paul riesling. though he was a player of violins and an interestingly unhappy husband, he was also a very able salesman of tar-roofing. he listened to the fat man's remarks on “the value of house-organs and bulletins as a method of jazzing-up the boys out on the road;” and he himself offered one or two excellent thoughts on the use of two-cent stamps on circulars. then he committed an offense against the holy law of the clan of good fellows. he became highbrow. they were entering a city. on the outskirts they passed a steel-mill which flared in scarlet and orange flame that licked at the cadaverous stacks, at the iron-sheathed walls and sullen converters.
flanagan, and ralph, after consulting each other. “good,” said mr. fogg. “the train leaves for dover at a quarter before nine. i will take it.” “this very evening?” asked stuart. “this very evening,” returned phileas fogg. he took out and consulted a pocket almanac, and added, “as today is wednesday, the 2nd of october, i shall be due in london in this very room of the reform club, on saturday, the 21st of december, at a quarter before nine p.m.; or else the twenty thousand pounds, now deposited in my name at baring’s, will belong to you, in fact and in right, gentlemen. here is a cheque for the amount.” a memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six parties, during which phileas fogg preserved a stoical composure. he certainly did not bet to win, and had only stake
than ever, rodolphe having succeeded in carrying out the adultery after his own fancy; and at the end of six months, when the spring-time came, they were to one another like a married couple, tranquilly keeping up a domestic flame. it was the time of year when old rouault sent his turkey in remembrance of the setting of his leg. the present always arrived with a letter. emma cut the string that tied it to the basket, and read the following lines:-- “my dear children--i hope this will find you well, and that this one will be as good as the others. for it seems to me a little more tender, if i may venture to say so, and heavier. but next time, for a change, i’ll give you a turkeycock, unless you have a preference for some dabs; and send me back the hamper, if you please, with the two old one
\"then, sir, you suppose that they will board us?\" i am certain of it. well, sir, let them come. i see no reason for hindering them. after all, these papuans are poor creatures, and i am unwilling that my visit to the island should cost the life of a single one of these wretches. upon that i was going away; but captain nemo detained me, and asked me to sit down by him. he questioned me with interest about our excursions on shore, and our hunting; and seemed not to understand the craving for meat that possessed the canadian. then the conversation turned on various subjects, and, without being more communicative, captain nemo showed himself more amiable. amongst other things, we happened to speak of the situation of the nautilus, run aground in exactly the same spot in this strait
house. étienne, as secretary, had divided the three thousand francs of the provident fund among the needy families; afterwards from various sides several hundred francs had arrived, yielded by subscriptions and collections. but now all their resources were exhausted; the miners had no more money to keep up the strike, and hunger was there, threatening them. maigrat, after having promised credit for a fortnight, had suddenly altered his mind at the end of a week and cut off provisions. he usually took his orders from the company; perhaps the latter wished to bring the matter to an end by starving the settlements. he acted besides like a capricious tyrant, giving or refusing bread according to the look of the girl who was sent by her parents for provisions; and he especially closed his
woman ever learns to drive like a man.” “well, now, there's some mighty good woman drivers.” “oh, of course, these women that try to imitate men, and play golf and everything, and ruin their complexions and spoil their hands!” “that's so. i never did like these mannish females.” “i mean--of course, i admire them, dreadfully, and i feel so weak and useless beside them.” “oh, rats now! i bet you play the piano like a wiz.” “oh, no--i mean--not really.” “well, i'll bet you do!” he glanced at her smooth hands, her diamond and ruby rings. she caught the glance, snuggled her hands together with a kittenish curving of slim white fingers which delighted him, and yearned: “i do love to play--i mean--i like to drum on the piano, but i haven't had any real training. mr. judique used to say i would
among the black bushes behind us, and dim against their blackness, i saw three crouching figures. there was scrub and long grass all about us, and i did not feel safe from their insidious approach. the forest, i calculated, was rather less than a mile across. if we could get through it to the bare hillside, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether safer resting-place; i thought that with my matches and my camphor i could contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. yet it was evident that if i was to flourish matches with my hands i should have to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, i put it down. and then it came into my head that i would amaze our friends behind by lighting it. i was to discover the atrocious folly of this proceeding, but it came to my mind as
useful.” this last sentence revealed the one great fear that possessed the rougons. they were afraid that some one might prove too useful, and do more than themselves to save the town. still, pierre saw no serious danger in leaving vuillet as provisional postmaster; it was even a convenient means of getting rid of him. félicité, however, made a sharp gesture of annoyance. the consultation having ended, the three accomplices mingled with the various groups that filled the drawing-room. they were at last obliged to satisfy the general curiosity by giving detailed accounts of recent events. rougon proved magnificent. he exaggerated, embellished, and dramatised the story which he had related to his wife. the distribution of the guns and cartridges made everybody hold their breath. but it
lodger, a big dark fellow of thirty-five with a placid, honest air: is the soup ready, louis? i believe it is. then the wife is good-humoured to-day. yes, i believe she is. other miners bound for the earth-cutting came up, new bands which one by one were engulfed in the pit. it was the three o'clock descent, more men for the pit to devour, the gangs who would replace the sets of the pikemen at the bottom of the passages. the mine never rested; day and night human insects were digging out the rock six hundred metres below the beetroot fields. however, the youngsters went ahead. jeanlin confided to bébert a complicated plan for getting four sous' worth of tobacco on credit, while lydie followed respectfully at a distance. catherine came with zacharie and étienne. none of them
the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the night. and then i thought once more of the meat that i had seen. i felt assured now of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart i pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity. clearly, at some time in the long-ago of human decay the morlocks’ food had run short. possibly they had lived on rats and such-like vermin. even now man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he was—far less than any monkey. his prejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct. and so these inhuman sons of men——! i tried to look at the thing in a scientific spirit. after all, they were less human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago. and the intelligence that
beasts of the field;” or, as it is commonly called, the game; and none, i believe, will deny but that those squires fulfil this end of their creation. little jones went one day a shooting with the gamekeeper; when happening to spring a covey of partridges near the border of that manor over which fortune, to fulfil the wise purposes of nature, had planted one of the game consumers, the birds flew into it, and were marked (as it is called) by the two sportsmen, in some furze bushes, about two or three hundred paces beyond mr allworthy's dominions. mr allworthy had given the fellow strict orders, on pain of forfeiting his place, never to trespass on any of his neighbours; no more on those who were less rigid in this matter than on the lord of this manor. with regard to others, indeed,
turned pale. “do you understand now?” said raskolnikov, his face twitching nervously. “go back, go to them,” he said suddenly, and turning quickly, he went out of the house. i will not attempt to describe how razumihin went back to the ladies, how he soothed them, how he protested that rodya needed rest in his illness, protested that rodya was sure to come, that he would come every day, that he was very, very much upset, that he must not be irritated, that he, razumihin, would watch over him, would get him a doctor, the best doctor, a consultation.... in fact from that evening razumihin took his place with them as a son and a brother. raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where sonia lived. it was an old green house of three storeys. he found the porter and
a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. this was his plan of amends—of atonement—for inheriting their father’s estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part. his plan did not vary on seeing them. miss bennet’s lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled choice. the next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with mrs. bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house,
aspects, does nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible. from its snowy aspect, the gauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the white squall. nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary. how wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their faction, the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the market-place! nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. it cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble
and so i came up—took my chance,’ said the russian. ‘oh, he is bad, very bad.’ i directed my glass to the house. there were no signs of life, but there was the ruined roof, the long mud wall peeping above the grass, with three little square window-holes, no two of the same size; all this brought within reach of my hand, as it were. and then i made a brusque movement, and one of the remaining posts of that vanished fence leaped up in the field of my glass. you remember i told you i had been struck at the distance by certain attempts at ornamentation, rather remarkable in the ruinous aspect of the place. now i had suddenly a nearer view, and its first result was to make me throw my head back as if before a blow. then i went carefully from post to post with my glass, and i saw my
\"my friend the law-stationer's good lady, over there,\" says mr. bucket, luring mrs. snagsby forward with the finger. what may your game be, ma'am? mrs. snagsby is at first prevented, by tears and lamentations, from stating the nature of her game, but by degrees it confusedly comes to light that she is a woman overwhelmed with injuries and wrongs, whom mr. snagsby has habitually deceived, abandoned, and sought to keep in darkness, and whose chief comfort, under her afflictions, has been the sympathy of the late mr. tulkinghorn, who showed so much commiseration for her on one occasion of his calling in cook's court in the absence of her perjured husband that she has of late habitually carried to him all her woes. everybody it appears, the present company excepted, has plotted against
up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood. “the first thing i’ve got to do,” said alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. i think that will be the best plan.” it sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry. an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and fee
and thus furnished with everything needful, we sailed out of the port to fish. the castle, which is at the entrance of the port, knew who we were, and took no notice of us; and we were not above a mile out of the port before we hauled in our sail and set us down to fish. the wind blew from the n.n.e., which was contrary to my desire, for had it blown southerly i had been sure to have made the coast of spain, and at least reached to the bay of cadiz; but my resolutions were, blow which way it would, i would be gone from that horrid place where i was, and leave the rest to fate. after we had fished some time and caught nothing—for when i had fish on my hook i would not pull them up, that he might not see them—i said to the moor, “this will not do; our master will not be thus served; we must
great deal he did not see and did not want to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes. it was loathsome and unbearable for him to look. but in the end there was much that surprised him and he began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much that he had not suspected before. what surprised him most of all was the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest. they seemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they at him with distrust and hostility. he felt and knew the reasons of his isolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons were so deep and strong. there were some polish exiles, political prisoners, among them. they simply looked down upon all the rest as ignorant churls; but raskolnikov could not look upon them like
that he fled from society, or contracted an habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must not be depended on—for he did neither. he lived to exert, and frequently to enjoy himself. his wife was not always out of humour, nor his home always uncomfortable; and in his breed of horses and dogs, and in sporting of every kind, he found no inconsiderable degree of domestic felicity. for marianne, however, in spite of his incivility in surviving her loss, he always retained that decided regard which interested him in every thing that befell her, and made her his secret standard of perfection in woman; and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him in after-days as bearing no comparison with mrs. brandon. mrs. dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without attempting
out of his coat, he seemed to hesitate. finally, he came back, went over to the picture, and examined it. in the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk blinds, the face appeared to him to be a little changed. the expression looked different. one would have said that there was a touch of cruelty in the mouth. it was certainly strange. he turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind. the bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky corners, where they lay shuddering. but the strange expression that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be more intensified even. the quivering ardent sunlight showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking into a mirror
and, as we might say, seized upon that man or thing as her own property, so far as she desired it, but without yielding the minutest degree of control over her motions in requital. the puritans looked on, and, if they smiled, were none the less inclined to pronounce the child a demon offspring, from the indescribable charm of beauty and eccentricity that shone through her little figure, and sparkled with its activity. she ran and looked the wild indian in the face, and he grew conscious of a nature wilder than his own. thence, with native audacity, but still with a reserve as characteristic, she flew into the midst of a group of mariners, the swarthy-cheeked wild men of the ocean, as the indians were of the land; and they gazed wonderingly and admiringly at pearl, as if a flake
could not be skeptical about these, for the worker bore the evidence of them about on his own person—generally he had only to hold out his hand. there were the men in the pickle rooms, for instance, where old antanas had gotten his death; scarce a one of these that had not some spot of horror on his person. let a man so much as scrape his finger pushing a truck in the pickle rooms, and he might have a sore that would put him out of the world; all the joints in his fingers might be eaten by the acid, one by one. of the butchers and floorsmen, the beef-boners and trimmers, and all those who used knives, you could scarcely find a person who had the use of his thumb; time and time again the base of it had been slashed, till it was a mere lump of flesh against which the man pressed the knife
a breath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain. my god, harry, how i worship her!” he was walking up and down the room as he spoke. hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks. he was terribly excited. lord henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure. how different he was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in basil hallward’s studio! his nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of scarlet flame. out of its secret hiding-place had crept his soul, and desire had come to meet it on the way. “and what do you propose to do?” said lord henry at last. “i want you and basil to come with me some night and see her act. i have not the slightest fear of the result. you are certain to acknowledge her genius. then we must get her
back the wandering hair that _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister’s dream. the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by—the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it—once more the shriek of the gryphon, the squeaking of the lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the
of thought, that were piercing me through and through. i walked a considerable part of the night, and excessive weariness at length conquered my repugnance to the availing myself of the deserted habitations of my species. the waning moon, which had just risen, shewed me a cottage, whose neat entrance and trim garden reminded me of my own england. i lifted up the latch of the door and entered. a kitchen first presented itself, where, guided by the moon beams, i found materials for striking a light. within this was a bed room; the couch was furnished with sheets of snowy whiteness; the wood piled on the hearth, and an array as for a meal, might almost have deceived me into the dear belief that i had here found what i had so long sought--one survivor, a companion for my loneliness, a
i had not mentioned it, thought at first that it was a gigantic sea-serpent. but i undeceived the worthy fellow, and by way of consolation related several particulars in the laying of this cable. the first one was laid in the years 1857 and 1858; but, after transmitting about 400 telegrams, would not act any longer. in 1863 the engineers constructed an other one, measuring 2,000 miles in length, and weighing 4,500 tons, which was embarked on the great eastern. this attempt also failed. on the 25th of may the nautilus, being at a depth of more than 1,918 fathoms, was on the precise spot where the rupture occurred which ruined the enterprise. it was within 638 miles of the coast of ireland; and at half-past two in the afternoon they discovered that communication with europe had ceased.
not at first understand how he had come there. but during the two or three days after katerina ivanovna’s death, he had two or three times met svidrigaïlov at sonia’s lodging, where he had gone aimlessly for a moment. they exchanged a few words and made no reference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not to speak of it for a time. katerina ivanovna’s body was still lying in the coffin, svidrigaïlov was busy making arrangements for the funeral. sonia too was very busy. at their last meeting svidrigaïlov informed raskolnikov that he had made an arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for katerina ivanovna’s children; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at once placed in
cheeks. she was a much more radical politician than her husband. pluchart's letter, she said. ah! if that fellow was master things would soon go better. étienne had been listening for a moment; he understood and became excited over these ideas of misery and revenge. this name, suddenly uttered, caused him to start. he said aloud, as if in spite of himself: i know him--pluchart. they looked at him. he had to add: yes, i am an engine-man: he was my foreman at lille. a capable man. i have often talked with him. rasseneur examined him afresh; and there was a rapid change on his face, a sudden sympathy. at last he said to his wife: it's maheu who brings me this gentleman, one of his putters, to see if there is a room for him upstairs, and if we can give him credit for a fortnight. 
was, that i had been caught in a strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind. “now,” said a suppressed voice with an oath, “i’ve got you!” “what is this?” i cried, struggling. “who is it? help, help, help!” not only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on my bad arm caused me exquisite pain. sometimes, a strong man’s hand, sometimes a strong man’s breast, was set against my mouth to deaden my cries, and with a hot breath always close to me, i struggled ineffectually in the dark, while i was fastened tight to the wall. “and now,” said the suppressed voice with another oath, “call out again, and i’ll make short work of you!” faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the surprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be
marvels accumulated in this museum. for it was in fact a museum, in which an intelligent and prodigal hand had gathered all the treasures of nature and art, with the artistic confusion which distinguishes a painter's studio. thirty first-rate pictures, uniformly framed, separated by bright drapery, ornamented the walls, which were hung with tapestry of severe design. i saw works of great value, the greater part of which i had admired in the special collections of europe, and in the exhibitions of paintings. the several schools of the old masters were represented by a madonna of raphael, a virgin of leonardo da vinci, a nymph of corregio, a woman of titan, an adoration of veronese, an assumption of murillo, a portrait of holbein, a monk of velasquez, a martyr of ribera, a fair of
with water, wrapped in towels, dried, and after a piercing scream, handed to his mother. “well, i am glad you are beginning to love him,” said kitty to her husband, when she had settled herself comfortably in her usual place, with the baby at her breast. “i am so glad! it had begun to distress me. you said you had no feeling for him.” “no; did i say that? i only said i was disappointed.” “what! disappointed in him?” “not disappointed in him, but in my own feeling; i had expected more. i had expected a rush of new delightful emotion to come as a surprise. and then instead of that—disgust, pity....” she listened attentively, looking at him over the baby, while she put back on her slender fingers the rings she had taken off while giving mitya his bath. “and most of all, at there being
hen they were all gone, the old man leaned on the gate again, watching them across the lane along the home close, and through the far gate, till they disappeared behind a bend in the hedge. for the hedgerows in those days shut out one's view, even on the better-managed farms; and this afternoon, the dog-roses were tossing out their pink wreaths, the nightshade was in its yellow and purple glory, the pale honeysuckle grew out of reach, peeping high up out of a holly bush, and over all an ash or a sycamore every now and then threw its shadow across the path. there were acquaintances at other gates who had to move aside and let them pass: at the gate of the home close there was half the dairy of cows standing one behind the other, extremely slow to understand that their large bodies might be
there were grunts of joy, all the backs were roasted at a distance till they smoked like soup. when their flanks were burning they cooked their bellies. mouquette had tranquilly let down her breeches to dry her chemise. some lads were making fun of her; they burst out laughing because she suddenly showed them her posterior, a gesture which in her was the extreme expression of contempt. i'm off, said chaval, who had shut up his tools in his box. no one moved. only mouquette hastened, and went out behind him on the pretext that they were both going back to montsou. but the others went on joking; they knew that he would have no more to do with her. catherine, however, who seemed preoccupied, was speaking in a low voice to her father. the latter was surprised; then he agreed with a nod;
whom he would have given a crushing blow, had not fix rushed in and received it in his stead. an enormous bruise immediately made its appearance under the detective’s silk hat, which was completely smashed in. “yankee!” exclaimed mr. fogg, darting a contemptuous look at the ruffian. “englishman!” returned the other. “we will meet again!” “when you please.” “what is your name?” “phileas fogg. and yours?” “colonel stamp proctor.” the human tide now swept by, after overturning fix, who speedily got upon his feet again, though with tattered clothes. happily, he was not seriously hurt. his travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal parts, and his trousers resembled those of certain indians, which fit less compactly than they are easy to put on. aouda had escaped unharmed, and fix
a savage made his appearance. twenty sioux had fallen mortally wounded to the ground, and the wheels crushed those who fell upon the rails as if they had been worms. several passengers, shot or stunned, lay on the seats. it was necessary to put an end to the struggle, which had lasted for ten minutes, and which would result in the triumph of the sioux if the train was not stopped. fort kearney station, where there was a garrison, was only two miles distant; but, that once passed, the sioux would be masters of the train between fort kearney and the station beyond. the conductor was fighting beside mr. fogg, when he was shot and fell. at the same moment he cried, “unless the train is stopped in five minutes, we are lost!” “it shall be stopped,” said phileas fogg, preparing to rush fro
led in his drawing-room. the medical man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his watch in the other. i looked round for the time traveller, and—“it’s half-past seven now,” said the medical man. “i suppose we’d better have dinner?” “where’s——?” said i, naming our host. “you’ve just come? it’s rather odd. he’s unavoidably detained. he asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he’s not back. says he’ll explain when he comes.” “it seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,” said the editor of a well-known daily paper; and thereupon the doctor rang the bell. the psychologist was the only person besides the doctor and myself who had attended the previous dinner. the other men were blank, the editor aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another—a quiet
it is for the sake of the person who has given them to her, and her thoughts are gone back now to the moment when they were put into her hands. no; else why should she have cared to have ear-rings rather than anything else? and i know that she had longed for ear-rings from among all the ornaments she could imagine. “little, little ears!” arthur had said, pretending to pinch them one evening, as hetty sat beside him on the grass without her hat. “i wish i had some pretty ear-rings!” she said in a moment, almost before she knew what she was saying--the wish lay so close to her lips, it would flutter past them at the slightest breath. and the next day--it was only last week--arthur had ridden over to rosseter on purpose to buy them. that little wish so naively uttered seemed to him the
something lost over there in the black country, very far from the parisian boulevards which formed public opinion; it would soon be forgotten. the company had received official intimation to hush up the affair, and to put an end to a strike which from its irritating duration was becoming a social danger. so on wednesday morning three of the directors appeared at montsou. the little town, sick at heart, which had not dared hitherto to rejoice over the massacre, now breathed again, and tasted the joy of being saved. the weather, too, had become fine; there was a bright sun--one of those first february days which, with their moist warmth, tip the lilac shoots with green. all the shutters had been flung back at the administration building, the vast structure seemed alive again. and cheering
in a pitiable old scarf and a much-worn and often-mended pair of gloves, which she had brought down in a paper parcel. i had to preside, too, over the entertainment, consisting of a dish of fish, a roast fowl, a sweetbread, vegetables, pudding, and madeira; and it was so pleasant to see how she enjoyed it, and with what state and ceremony she did honour to it, that i was soon thinking of nothing else. when we had finished and had our little dessert before us, embellished by the hands of my dear, who would yield the superintendence of everything prepared for me to no one, miss flite was so very chatty and happy that i thought i would lead her to her own history, as she was always pleased to talk about herself. i began by saying you have attended on the lord chancellor many
but of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal scepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. a phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: “there are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and the tired.” “and daisy ought to have something in her life,” murmured jordan to me. “does she want to see gatsby?” “she’s not to know about it. gatsby doesn’t want her to know. you’re just supposed to invite her to tea.” we passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the façade of fifty-ninth street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. unlike gatsby and tom buchanan, i had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs, and so i drew up the girl beside me, tightening my
reveal the fatal termination to leonards’ fall from the platform. so dixon’s curiosity combined with her allegiance to urge margaret to go to rest, which her appearance, as she lay on the sofa, showed but too clearly that she required. she did not speak except when spoken to; she tried to smile back in reply to her father’s anxious looks and words of tender inquiry; but, instead of a smile, the wan lips resolved themselves into a sigh. he was so miserably uneasy that, at last, she consented to go into her own room, and prepare for going to bed. she was indeed inclined to give up the idea that the inspector would call again that night, as it was already past nine o’clock. she stood by her father, holding on to the back of his chair. “you will go to bed soon, papa, won’t you? don’t sit
you might easily dent it with your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. and this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist. some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were it not for impatient ahab’s loud command to stubb to desist, and come on board, else the ship would bid them good bye. . ambergris. now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain nantucket-born captain coffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that subject. for at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day, the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem to the learn

dixon laying out margaret’s dress on the bed; but no margaret. edith remained to fidget about. “oh, dixon! not those horrid blue flowers to that dead gold-coloured gown. what taste! wait a minute, and i will bring you some pomegranate blossoms.” “it’s not a dead gold-colour ma’am. it’s a straw-colour. and blue always goes with straw-colour.” but edith had brought the brilliant scarlet flowers before dixon had got half through her remonstrance. “where is miss hale?” asked edith, as soon as she had tried the effect of the garniture. “i can’t think,” she went on, pettishly, “how my aunt allowed her to get into such rambling habits in milton! i’m sure i’m always expecting to hear of her having met with something horrible among all those wretched places she pokes herself into. i should
just the same if we allow the insurgents to enter the town unmolested. i believe that before an hour has elapsed the mayor and all the functionaries will be prisoners, to say nothing of your husband and the frequenters of this drawing-room.” the marquis thought he saw a vague smile play about félicité’s lips as she answered, with a look of dismay: “do you really think so?” “of course!” replied sicardot; “the republicans are not so stupid as to leave enemies behind them. to-morrow plassans will be emptied of its functionaries and good citizens.” at these words, which she had so cleverly provoked, félicité released her husband’s arms. pierre no longer looked as if he wanted to go out. thanks to his wife, whose skilful tactics escaped him, however, and whose secret complicity he never

we had a curious conversation about driving a car. it started because she passed so close to some workmen that our fender flicked a button on one man’s coat. “you’re a rotten driver,” i protested. “either you ought to be more careful, or you oughtn’t to drive at all.” “i am careful.” “no, you’re not.” “well, other people are,” she said lightly. “what’s that got to do with it?” “they’ll keep out of my way,” she insisted. “it takes two to make an accident.” “suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.” “i hope i never will,” she answered. “i hate careless people. that’s why i like you.” her grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had deliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment i thought i loved her. but i am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that
of the new town on its right. it is here, about half-way along the street, that stands the sub-prefecture, in the rear of a small square planted with sickly trees; the people of plassans are very proud of this edifice. as if to keep more isolated and shut up within itself, the town is belted with old ramparts, which only serve to increase its gloom and render it more confined. these ridiculous fortifications, preyed upon by ivy and crowned with wild gillyflowers, are about as high and as thick as the walls of a convent, and could be demolished by gunshot. they have several openings, the principal of which, the porte de rome and the grand’-porte, afford access to the nice road and the lyons road, at the other end of town. until 1853 these openings were furnished with huge wooden
thought, or else the passionate fervour of his wish would have forced her to raise those eyes, if but for an instant, to read the late repentance in his. he could have struck her before he left, in order that by some strange overt act of rudeness, he might earn the privilege of telling her the remorse that gnawed at his heart. it was well that the long walk in the open air wound up this evening for him. it sobered him back into grave resolution that henceforth he would see as little of her as possible,--since the very sight of that face and form, the very sounds of that voice (like the soft winds of pure melody) had such power to move him from his balance. well! he had known what love was--a sharp pang, a fierce experience, in the midst of whose flames he was struggling! but, through
 the hall farm evidently that gate is never opened, for the long grass and the great hemlocks grow close against it, and if it were opened, it is so rusty that the force necessary to turn it on its hinges would be likely to pull down the square stone-built pillars, to the detriment of the two stone lionesses which grin with a doubtful carnivorous affability above a coat of arms surmounting each of the pillars. it would be easy enough, by the aid of the nicks in the stone pillars, to climb over the brick wall with its smooth stone coping; but by putting our eyes close to the rusty bars of the gate, we can see the house well enough, and all but the very corners of the grassy enclosure. it is a very fine old place, of red brick, softened by a pale powdery lichen, which has dispersed itself
then his father had met with misfortune in business and killed himself; and there had been his mother and a younger brother and sister. also, there was an invention of duane’s; jurgis could not understand it clearly, but it had to do with telegraphing, and it was a very important thing—there were fortunes in it, millions upon millions of dollars. and duane had been robbed of it by a great company, and got tangled up in lawsuits and lost all his money. then somebody had given him a tip on a horse race, and he had tried to retrieve his fortune with another person’s money, and had to run away, and all the rest had come from that. the other asked him what had led him to safe-breaking—to jurgis a wild and appalling occupation to think about. a man he had met, his cell mate had replied—one
day--i felt so miserable and self-reproachful that i clung to her and told her it was my fault, i knew, that she could say good-bye so easily! no, esther! she returned. it is your misfortune! the coach was at the little lawn-gate--we had not come out until we heard the wheels--and thus i left her, with a sorrowful heart. she went in before my boxes were lifted to the coach-roof and shut the door. as long as i could see the house, i looked back at it from the window through my tears. my godmother had left mrs. rachael all the little property she possessed; and there was to be a sale; and an old hearth-rug with roses on it, which always seemed to me the first thing in the world i had ever seen, was hanging outside in the frost and snow. a day or two before, i had wrapped the dear old
tag to express the bizarre and not a little sinister contrast between them. my house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from the sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. the one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual imitation of some hôtel de ville in normandy, with a tower on one side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. it was gatsby’s mansion. or, rather, as i didn’t know mr. gatsby, it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. my own house was an eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so i had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour’s lawn, and the
she clung to all that her human senses permitted her to see and feel to be a part of raymond. pale as marble, clear and beaming as that, she heard my tale, and enquired concerning the spot where he had been deposited. her features had lost the distortion of grief; her eyes were brightened, her very person seemed dilated; while the excessive whiteness and even transparency of her skin, and something hollow in her voice, bore witness that not tranquillity, but excess of excitement, occasioned the treacherous calm that settled on her countenance. i asked her where he should be buried. she replied, at athens; even at the athens which he loved. without the town, on the acclivity of hymettus, there is a rocky recess which he pointed out to me as the spot where he would wish to repose. my
salvation of her soul, that she did as tightly reined horses; she pulled up short and the bit slipped from her teeth. this nature, positive in the midst of its enthusiasms, that had loved the church for the sake of the flowers, and music for the words of the songs, and literature for its passional stimulus, rebelled against the mysteries of faith as it grew irritated by discipline, a thing antipathetic to her constitution. when her father took her from school, no one was sorry to see her go. the lady superior even thought that she had latterly been somewhat irreverent to the community. emma, at home once more, first took pleasure in looking after the servants, then grew disgusted with the country and missed her convent. when charles came to the bertaux for the first time, she thought her
then led me aft; and in passing before ned's and conseil's cabin, i called my two companions, who followed promptly. we then came to a cell near the machinery-room, in which we put on our walking-dress. a walk on the bottom of the sea this cell was, to speak correctly, the arsenal and wardrobe of the nautilus. a dozen diving apparatuses hung from the partition waiting our use. ned land, on seeing them, showed evident repugnance to dress himself in one. but, my worthy ned, the forests of the island of crespo are nothing but submarine forests. good! said the disappointed harpooner, who saw his dreams of fresh meat fade away. and you, m. aronnax, are you going to dress yourself in those clothes? there is no alternative, master ned. as you please, sir, replied the harpooner,

now but the brown earth under the white thorn. yet she cried less to-day than she had done any day since her husband's death. along with all her grief there was mixed an unusual sense of her own importance in having a “burial,” and in mr. irwine's reading a special service for her husband; and besides, she knew the funeral psalm was going to be sung for him. she felt this counter-excitement to her sorrow still more strongly as she walked with her sons towards the church door, and saw the friendly sympathetic nods of their fellow-parishioners. the mother and sons passed into the church, and one by one the loiterers followed, though some still lingered without; the sight of mr. donnithorne's carriage, which was winding slowly up the hill, perhaps helping to make them feel that there was no

he went up to it quietly and felt that there was someone hiding behind it. he cautiously moved the cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent double so that he couldn’t see her face; but it was she. he stood over her. “she is afraid,” he thought. he stealthily took the axe from the noose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. but strange to say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood. he was frightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too, bent her head lower. he bent right down to the ground and peeped up into her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old woman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing her utmost that he should not hear it. suddenly he fancied that the
sudden realisation of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. i shouted at them as loudly as i could. they started away, and then i could feel them approaching me again. they clutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. i shivered violently, and shouted again—rather discordantly. this time they were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they came back at me. i will confess i was horribly frightened. i determined to strike another match and escape under the protection of its glare. i did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket, i made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. but i had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blackness i could hear

seemed to have worked; and i sometimes asked myself if some inhabitant of these submarine regions would not suddenly appear to me. but captain nemo was still mounting. i could not stay behind. i followed boldly. my stick gave me good help. a false step would have been dangerous on the narrow passes sloping down to the sides of the gulfs; but i walked with firm step, without feeling any giddiness. now i jumped a crevice, the depth of which would have made me hesitate had it been among the glaciers on the land; now i ventured on the unsteady trunk of a tree thrown across from one abyss to the other, without looking under my feet, having only eyes to admire the wild sites of this region. there, monumental rocks, leaning on their regularly-cut bases, seemed to defy all laws of equilibrium.
grey hour when things are just creeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut, and yet unreal. i got up, and went down into the great hall, and so out upon the flagstones in front of the palace. i thought i would make a virtue of necessity, and see the sunrise. “the moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. the bushes were inky black, the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. and up the hill i thought i could see ghosts. three several times, as i scanned the slope, i saw white figures. twice i fancied i saw a solitary white, ape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the ruins i saw a leash of them carrying some dark body. they moved hastily. i did not see

it’s all done for you, and never dream that it is really the grand climax of the century-long battle of commercial competition—the final death grapple between the chiefs of the beef trust and ‘standard oil,’ for the prize of the mastery and ownership of the united states of america!” such was the new home in which jurgis lived and worked, and in which his education was completed. perhaps you would imagine that he did not do much work there, but that would be a great mistake. he would have cut off one hand for tommy hinds; and to keep hinds’s hotel a thing of beauty was his joy in life. that he had a score of socialist arguments chasing through his brain in the meantime did not interfere with this; on the contrary, jurgis scrubbed the spittoons and polished the banisters all the more
standing there. raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph. with slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, raskolnikov made his way back to his little garret, feeling chilled all over. he took off his cap and put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving. then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he stretched himself on it. so he lay for half an hour. he thought of nothing. some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some images without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would never have recalled, the belfry of the church at v., the billiard table in a restaurant and some officers playing

served a multitude of imaginary personages, old and young, to talk withal. the pine-trees, aged, black, and solemn, and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze, needed little transformation to figure as puritan elders; the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children, whom pearl smote down and uprooted most unmercifully. it was wonderful, the vast variety of forms into which she threw her intellect, with no continuity, indeed, but darting up and dancing, always in a state of preternatural activity--soon sinking down, as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of life--and succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy. it was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the northern lights. in the mere exercise of the fancy, however, and the

some thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them towards me, and said it was mine. i was going to remonstrate; but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers’ pockets. i let them stay. he then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed the paper fireboard. by certain signs and symptoms, i thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, i deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, i would comply or otherwise. i was a good christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible presbyterian church. how then could i unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood? but what is worship? thought i. do you suppose now,

fingers and his terror of the snow—his wailing voice rang in jurgis’s ears, as he lay there in the darkness, until the sweat started on his forehead. now and then he would quiver with a sudden spasm of horror, at the picture of little stanislovas shut up in the deserted building and fighting for his life with the rats! all these emotions had become strangers to the soul of jurgis; it was so long since they had troubled him that he had ceased to think they might ever trouble him again. helpless, trapped, as he was, what good did they do him—why should he ever have allowed them to torment him? it had been the task of his recent life to fight them down, to crush them out of him; never in his life would he have suffered from them again, save that they had caught him unawares, and

the arrival of the “mongolia.” the porters and fellahs rushed down the quay, and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore to go and meet the steamer. soon her gigantic hull appeared passing along between the banks, and eleven o’clock struck as she anchored in the road. she brought an unusual number of passengers, some of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the town, while the greater part disembarked in the boats, and landed on the quay. fix took up a position, and carefully examined each face and figure which made its appearance. presently one of the passengers, after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters, came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the english consulate, at the same time showing a passport which he wished

had i any tools to go about it with. i spent many a day to find out a great stone big enough to cut hollow, and make fit for a mortar, and could find none at all, except what was in the solid rock, and which i had no way to dig or cut out; nor indeed were the rocks in the island of hardness sufficient, but were all of a sandy, crumbling stone, which neither would bear the weight of a heavy pestle, nor would break the corn without filling it with sand. so, after a great deal of time lost in searching for a stone, i gave it over, and resolved to look out for a great block of hard wood, which i found, indeed, much easier; and getting one as big as i had strength to stir, i rounded it, and formed it on the outside with my axe and hatchet, and then with the help of fire and infinite labour,

sad tears to theirs; all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause. i was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror. the death of william, the execution of justine, the murder of clerval, and lastly of my wife; even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now might be writhing under his grasp, and ernest might be dead at his feet. this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action. i started up and resolved to return to geneva with all possible speed. there were no horses to be procured, and i must return by the lake; but the wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. however, it was
sideways at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text, when he said here we were at barnard’s inn. my depression was not alleviated by the announcement, for, i had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by mr. barnard, to which the blue boar in our town was a mere public-house. whereas i now found barnard to be a disembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for tom-cats. we entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me like a flat burying-ground. i thought it had the most dismal trees in it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most dismal
what had been, rather than what was. charlotte’s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like lady catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. she wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. the house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and lady catherine’s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. it was mr. collins’s picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened; and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know

exclaimed pierronne, when maheude had returned the coffee. there was no hurry. she was twenty-eight, and was considered the beauty of the settlement, dark, with a low forehead, large eyes, straight mouth, and coquettish as well; with the neatness of a cat, and with a good figure, for she had had no children. her mother, brulé, the widow of a pikeman who died in the mine, after having sent her daughter to work in a factory, swearing that she should never marry a collier, had never ceased to be angry since she had married, somewhat late, pierron, a widower with a girl of eight. however, the household lived very happily, in the midst of chatter, of scandals which circulated concerning the husband's complaisance and the wife's lovers. no debts, meat twice a week, a house kept so clean
their head, and just behind him were passepartout and the other two travellers, rescued from the sioux. they had met and fought the indians ten miles south of fort kearney. shortly before the detachment arrived, passepartout and his companions had begun to struggle with their captors, three of whom the frenchman had felled with his fists, when his master and the soldiers hastened up to their relief. all were welcomed with joyful cries. phileas fogg distributed the reward he had promised to the soldiers, while passepartout, not without reason, muttered to himself, “it must certainly be confessed that i cost my master dear!” fix, without saying a word, looked at mr. fogg, and it would have been difficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within him. as for aouda, she took her
in about seven days from the time of their arrival. it gave her no surprise that she saw nothing of mrs. palmer; and as it gave her likewise no concern, she never mentioned her name. two days passed away from the time of mr. palmer’s departure, and her situation continued, with little variation, the same. mr. harris, who attended her every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and miss dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others was by no means so cheerful. mrs. jennings had determined very early in the seizure that marianne would never get over it, and colonel brandon, who was chiefly of use in listening to mrs. jennings’s forebodings, was not in a state of mind to resist their influence. he tried to reason himself out of fears, which the different
arms that one might have thought were made of petrified blood. upon a sign from captain nemo one of the men advanced; and at some feet from the cross he began to dig a hole with a pickaxe that he took from his belt. i understood all! this glade was a cemetery, this hole a tomb, this oblong object the body of the man who had died in the night! the captain and his men had come to bury their companion in this general resting-place, at the bottom of this inaccessible ocean! the grave was being dug slowly; the fish fled on all sides while their retreat was being thus disturbed; i heard the strokes of the pickaxe, which sparkled when it hit upon some flint lost at the bottom of the waters. the hole was soon large and deep enough to receive the body. then the bearers approached; the body,
about to rush up the near mountain-path, when the door of a summer-house at the end of the garden slowly opened, and clara appeared, not advancing towards us, but leaning against a column of the building with blanched cheeks, in a posture of utter despondency. adrian sprang towards her with a cry of joy, and folded her delightedly in his arms. she withdrew from his embrace, and, without a word, again entered the summer-house. her quivering lips, her despairing heart refused to afford her voice to express our misfortune. poor little evelyn had, while playing with her, been seized with sudden fever, and now lay torpid and speechless on a little couch in the summer-house. for a whole fortnight we unceasingly watched beside the poor child, as his life declined under the ravages of a virulent
the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he left london would not seriously affect his journey. the “tankadere” entered the straits of fo-kien, which separate the island of formosa from the chinese coast, in the small hours of the night, and crossed the tropic of cancer. the sea was very rough in the straits, full of eddies formed by the counter-currents, and the chopping waves broke her course, whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck. at daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens seemed to predict a gale. the barometer announced a speedy change, the mercury rising and falling capriciously; the sea also, in the south-east, raised long surges which indicated a tempest. the sun had set the evening before in a red mist, in the midst of the phosphoresce

it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character. even after i was happily hanged and wopsle had closed the book, pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking his head, and saying, “take warning, boy, take warning!” as if it were a well-known fact that i contemplated murdering a near relation, provided i could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor. it was a very dark night when it was all over, and when i set out with mr. wopsle on the walk home. beyond town, we found a heavy mist out, and it fell wet and thick. the turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of the lamp’s usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance on the fog. we were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we
had taken on him a terrible vengeance for the fantastic invasion. i think it had whispered to him things about himself which he did not know, things of which he had no conception till he took counsel with this great solitude—and the whisper had proved irresistibly fascinating. it echoed loudly within him because he was hollow at the core.... i put down the glass, and the head that had appeared near enough to be spoken to seemed at once to have leaped away from me into inaccessible distance. “the admirer of mr. kurtz was a bit crestfallen. in a hurried, indistinct voice he began to assure me he had not dared to take these—say, symbols—down. he was not afraid of the natives; they would not stir till mr. kurtz gave the word. his ascendancy was extraordinary. the camps of these people
straw hats with their large clear eyes. some there were lounging in their carriages, gliding through parks, a greyhound bounding along in front of the equipage driven at a trot by two midget postilions in white breeches. others, dreaming on sofas with an open letter, gazed at the moon through a slightly open window half draped by a black curtain. the naive ones, a tear on their cheeks, were kissing doves through the bars of a gothic cage, or, smiling, their heads on one side, were plucking the leaves of a marguerite with their taper fingers, that curved at the tips like peaked shoes. and you, too, were there, sultans with long pipes reclining beneath arbours in the arms of bayaderes; djiaours, turkish sabres, greek caps; and you especially, pale landscapes of dithyrambic lands, that often

which, as i heard, was for want of money, he used constantly, once or twice a week, sometimes oftener if the weather was fair, to take the ship’s pinnace and go out into the road a-fishing; and as he always took me and young maresco with him to row the boat, we made him very merry, and i proved very dexterous in catching fish; insomuch that sometimes he would send me with a moor, one of his kinsmen, and the youth—the maresco, as they called him—to catch a dish of fish for him. it happened one time, that going a-fishing in a calm morning, a fog rose so thick that, though we were not half a league from the shore, we lost sight of it; and rowing we knew not whither or which way, we laboured all day, and all the next night; and when the morning came we found we had pulled off to sea instead

not have been easy to select the same number of wise and virtuous persons, who should be less capable of sitting in judgment on an erring woman's heart, and disentangling its mesh of good and evil, than the sages of rigid aspect towards whom hester prynne now turned her face. she seemed conscious, indeed, that whatever sympathy she might expect lay in the larger and warmer heart of the multitude; for, as she lifted her eyes towards the balcony, the unhappy woman grew pale, and trembled. the voice which had called her attention was that of the reverend and famous john wilson, the eldest clergyman of boston, a great scholar, like most of his contemporaries in the profession, and withal a man of kind and genial spirit. this last attribute, however, had been less carefully developed than
are you in love with me,” she said low in my ear, “or why did i have to come alone?” “that’s the secret of castle rackrent. tell your chauffeur to go far away and spend an hour.” “come back in an hour, ferdie.” then in a grave murmur: “his name is ferdie.” “does the gasoline affect his nose?” “i don’t think so,” she said innocently. “why?” we went in. to my overwhelming surprise the living-room was deserted. “well, that’s funny,” i exclaimed. “what’s funny?” she turned her head as there was a light dignified knocking at the front door. i went out and opened it. gatsby, pale as death, with his hands plunged like weights in his coat pockets, was standing in a puddle of water glaring tragically into my eyes. with his hands still in his coat pockets he stalked by me into the hall, turned sharp
began to sip his chocolate. the mellow november sun came streaming into the room. the sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air. it was almost like a morning in may. gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent, blood-stained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there with terrible distinctness. he winced at the memory of all that he had suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for basil hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came back to him, and he grew cold with passion. the dead man was still sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. how horrible that was! such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day. he felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken or grow
part of his nights at the club, again and again slipping out of his father’s office like a schoolboy to go and gamble away the few louis that his mother gave him clandestinely. it is necessary to have lived in the depths of the french provinces to form an idea of the four brutifying years which the young fellow spent in this fashion. in every little town there is a group of individuals who thus live on their parents, pretending at times to work, but in reality cultivating idleness with a sort of religious zeal. aristide was typical of these incorrigible drones. for four years he did little but play écarté. while he passed his time at the club, his wife, a fair-complexioned nerveless woman, helped to ruin the rougon business by her inordinate passion for showy gowns and her formidable
complete his happiness. he often left us, and wandered by himself in the woods, or sailed in his little skiff, his books his only companions. he was often the gayest of our party, at the same time that he was the only one visited by fits of despondency; his slender frame seemed overcharged with the weight of life, and his soul appeared rather to inhabit his body than unite with it. i was hardly more devoted to my idris than to her brother, and she loved him as her teacher, her friend, the benefactor who had secured to her the fulfilment of her dearest wishes. raymond, the ambitious, restless raymond, reposed midway on the great high-road of life, and was content to give up all his schemes of sovereignty and fame, to make one of us, the flowers of the field. his kingdom was the heart of
force for a perfect cut, and no more. so through various yawning holes there slipped to the floor below—to one room hams, to another forequarters, to another sides of pork. one might go down to this floor and see the pickling rooms, where the hams were put into vats, and the great smoke rooms, with their airtight iron doors. in other rooms they prepared salt pork—there were whole cellars full of it, built up in great towers to the ceiling. in yet other rooms they were putting up meats in boxes and barrels, and wrapping hams and bacon in oiled paper, sealing and labeling and sewing them. from the doors of these rooms went men with loaded trucks, to the platform where freight cars were waiting to be filled; and one went out there and realized with a start that he had come at last to
the county by the wanton luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life, he would suddenly leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not been tampered with and that the picture was still there. what if it should be stolen? the mere thought made him cold with horror. surely the world would know his secret then. perhaps the world already suspected it. for, while he fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him. he was very nearly blackballed at a west end club of which his birth and social position fully entitled him to become a member, and it was said that on one occasion, when he was brought by a friend into the smoking-room of the churchill, the duke of berwick and another gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out. curious stories became
like a harp-string nearly breaking. after this she began to scream horribly. she cursed the poison, railed at it, and implored it to be quick, and thrust away with her stiffened arms everything that charles, in more agony than herself, tried to make her drink. he stood up, his handkerchief to his lips, with a rattling sound in his throat, weeping, and choked by sobs that shook his whole body. félicité was running hither and thither in the room. homais, motionless, uttered great sighs; and monsieur canivet, always retaining his self-command, nevertheless began to feel uneasy. “the devil! yet she has been purged, and from the moment that the cause ceases--” “the effect must cease,” said homais, “that is evident.” “oh, save her!” cried bovary. and, without listening to the chemist, who was

actually, the trial occupied less than fifteen minutes, largely filled with the evidence of doctors that zilla would recover and that paul must have been temporarily insane. next day paul was sentenced to three years in the state penitentiary and taken off--quite undramatically, not handcuffed, merely plodding in a tired way beside a cheerful deputy sheriff--and after saying good-by to him at the station babbitt returned to his office to realize that he faced a world which, without paul, was meaningless. i he was busy, from march to june. he kept himself from the bewilderment of thinking. his wife and the neighbors were generous. every evening he played bridge or attended the movies, and the days were blank of face and silent. in june, mrs. babbitt and tinka went east, to stay with

the urn was cold, and ordered up the great kitchen tea-kettle; the only consequence of which was that when she met it at the door, and tried to carry it in, it was too heavy for her, and she came in pouting, with a black mark on her muslin gown, and a little round white hand indented by the handle, which she took to show to captain lennox, just like a hurt child, and, of course, the remedy was the same in both cases. margaret’s quickly-adjusted spirit-lamp was the most efficacious contrivance, though not so like the gypsy-encampment which edith, in some of her moods, chose to consider the nearest resemblance to a barrack-life. after this evening all was bustle till the wedding was over. . roses and thorns. “by the soft green light in the woody glade, on the banks of moss where thy

behind the curtain of trees i had been acutely conscious all the time, flowed out of the woods again, filled the clearing, covered the slope with a mass of naked, breathing, quivering, bronze bodies. i steamed up a bit, then swung down stream, and two thousand eyes followed the evolutions of the splashing, thumping, fierce river-demon beating the water with its terrible tail and breathing black smoke into the air. in front of the first rank, along the river, three men, plastered with bright red earth from head to foot, strutted to and fro restlessly. when we came abreast again, they faced the river, stamped their feet, nodded their horned heads, swayed their scarlet bodies; they shook towards the fierce river-demon a bunch of black feathers, a mangy skin with a pendent tail—something
in number, and each of several barrels’ capacity. when not in use, they are kept remarkably clean. sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. during the night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap. while employed in polishing them—one man in each pot, side by side—many confidential communications are carried on, over the iron lips. it is a place also for profound mathematical meditation. it was in the left hand try-pot of the pequod, with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that i was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from any point in precisely the same time.

hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut. this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance. “and yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: “i should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if i’d only been the right size to do it! oh dear! i’d nearly forgotten that i’ve got to grow up again! let me see—how _is_ it to be managed? i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?” the great
of this short halt, while gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away. it was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. for several weeks i didn’t see him or hear his voice on the phone—mostly i was in new york, trotting around with jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt—but finally i went over to his house one sunday afternoon. i hadn’t been there two minutes when somebody brought tom buchanan in for a drink. i was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn’t happened before. they were a party of three on horseback—tom and a man named sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding-habit, who had been there previously. “i’m delighted to see you,” said gatsby, standing on his porch. “i’m delighted
century, had been a gigantic pine, with its roots and trunk in the darksome shade, and its head aloft in the upper atmosphere. it was a little dell where they had seated themselves, with a leaf-strewn bank rising gently on either side, and a brook flowing through the midst, over a bed of fallen and drowned leaves. the trees impending over it had flung down great branches from time to time, which choked up the current, and compelled it to form eddies and black depths at some points; while, in its swifter and livelier passages there appeared a channel-way of pebbles, and brown, sparkling sand. letting the eyes follow along the course of the stream, they could catch the reflected light from its water, at some short distance within the forest, but soon lost all traces of it amid the
in order, however, that our superior position might not be compromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the kitchen mantel-shelf, into which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were dropped. i have an impression that they were to be contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the national debt, but i know i had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure. mr. wopsle’s great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is to say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in the society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the improving opportunity of seeing her do it. she rented a small cottage, and mr. wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used
red to the wind in the meadows. she was afraid of the oxen; she began to run; she arrived out of breath, with rosy cheeks, and breathing out from her whole person a fresh perfume of sap, of verdure, of the open air. at this hour rodolphe still slept. it was like a spring morning coming into his room. the yellow curtains along the windows let a heavy, whitish light enter softly. emma felt about, opening and closing her eyes, while the drops of dew hanging from her hair formed, as it were, a topaz aureole around her face. rodolphe, laughing, drew her to him, and pressed her to his breast. then she examined the apartment, opened the drawers of the tables, combed her hair with his comb, and looked at herself in his shaving-glass. often she even put between her teeth the big pipe that lay on
hide. under that dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars. even were there no other lurking danger—a danger i did not care to let my imagination loose upon—there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the tree-boles to strike against. i was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so i decided that i would not face it, but would pass the night upon the open hill. “weena, i was glad to find, was fast asleep. i carefully wrapped her in my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. the hillside was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things. above me shone the stars, for the night was very clear. i felt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their twinkling. all the old
him, and what he dared not hope for, and yet was hoping for. he drove up to the steps. a sledge and a carriage with the coachman asleep stood at the entrance. as he went into the entry, alexey alexandrovitch, as it were, got out his resolution from the remotest corner of his brain, and mastered it thoroughly. its meaning ran: “if it’s a trick, then calm contempt and departure. if truth, do what is proper.” the porter opened the door before alexey alexandrovitch rang. the porter, kapitonitch, looked queer in an old coat, without a tie, and in slippers. “how is your mistress?” “a successful confinement yesterday.” alexey alexandrovitch stopped short and turned white. he felt distinctly now how intensely he had longed for her death. “and how is she?” korney in his morning apron ran
to each gate and double-lock it. when they had returned, several members confessed that they really felt more comfortable; and when pierre remarked that the critical situation of the town imposed upon them the duty of remaining at their posts, some of them made arrangements with the view of spending the night in an arm-chair. granoux put on a black silk skull cap which he had brought with him by way of precaution. towards eleven o’clock, half of the gentlemen were sleeping round monsieur garconnet’s writing table. those who still managed to keep their eyes open fancied, as they listened to the measured tramp of the national guards in the courtyard, that they were heroes and were receiving decorations. a large lamp, placed on the writing-table, illumined this strange vigil. all at once,
by that terrible fall. miserable, unresting night! ill preparation for the coming day! she awoke with a start, unrefreshed, and conscious of some reality worse even than her feverish dreams. it all came back upon her; not merely the sorrow, but the terrible discord in the sorrow. where, to what distance apart, had her father wandered, led by doubts which were to her temptations of the evil one? she longed to ask, and yet would not have heard for all the world. the fine crisp morning made her mother feel particularly well and happy at breakfast-time. she talked on, planning village kindness, unheeding the silence of her husband and the monosyllabic answers of margaret. before the things were cleared away, mr. hale got up; he leaned one hand on the table, as if to support himself: “i
mark of especial favour. but these were not the two cats which i brought on shore at first, for they were both of them dead, and had been interred near my habitation by my own hand; but one of them having multiplied by i know not what kind of creature, these were two which i had preserved tame; whereas the rest ran wild in the woods, and became indeed troublesome to me at last, for they would often come into my house, and plunder me too, till at last i was obliged to shoot them, and did kill a great many; at length they left me. with this attendance and in this plentiful manner i lived; neither could i be said to want anything but society; and of that, some time after this, i was likely to have too much. i was something impatient, as i have observed, to have the use of my boat, though very
on their heads, and the clink kept time with their footsteps. black rags were wound round their loins, and the short ends behind waggled to and fro like tails. i could see every rib, the joints of their limbs were like knots in a rope; each had an iron collar on his neck, and all were connected together with a chain whose bights swung between them, rhythmically clinking. another report from the cliff made me think suddenly of that ship of war i had seen firing into a continent. it was the same kind of ominous voice; but these men could by no stretch of imagination be called enemies. they were called criminals, and the outraged law, like the bursting shells, had come to them, an insoluble mystery from the sea. all their meagre breasts panted together, the violently dilated nostrils
place with the mob of the unemployed. this time, however, jurgis did not have the same fine confidence, nor the same reason for it. he was no longer the finest-looking man in the throng, and the bosses no longer made for him; he was thin and haggard, and his clothes were seedy, and he looked miserable. and there were hundreds who looked and felt just like him, and who had been wandering about packingtown for months begging for work. this was a critical time in jurgis’ life, and if he had been a weaker man he would have gone the way the rest did. those out-of-work wretches would stand about the packing houses every morning till the police drove them away, and then they would scatter among the saloons. very few of them had the nerve to face the rebuffs that they would encounter by trying
of himself, he may growl in the spirit, rain, rain, rain! nothing but rain--and no family here! as he goes in again and lies down with a gloomy yawn. so with the dogs in the kennel-buildings across the park, who have their restless fits and whose doleful voices when the wind has been very obstinate have even made it known in the house itself--upstairs, downstairs, and in my lady's chamber. they may hunt the whole country-side, while the raindrops are pattering round their inactivity. so the rabbits with their self-betraying tails, frisking in and out of holes at roots of trees, may be lively with ideas of the breezy days when their ears are blown about or of those seasons of interest when there are sweet young plants to gnaw. the turkey in the poultry-yard, always troubled with a class
it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. what lay heaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened between me and the day of departure; for i could not divest myself of a misgiving that something might happen to london in the meanwhile, and that, when i got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean gone. joe and biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when i spoke of our approaching separation; but they only referred to it when i did. after breakfast, joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best parlour, and we put them in the fire, and i felt that i was free. with all the novelty of my emancipation on me, i went to church with joe, and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn’t have read that about the rich man and the kingdom of heaven,

there a week, walking the streets where their footsteps had clicked together through the november night and revisiting the out-of-the-way places to which they had driven in her white car. just as daisy’s house had always seemed to him more mysterious and gay than other houses, so his idea of the city itself, even though she was gone from it, was pervaded with a melancholy beauty. he left feeling that if he had searched harder, he might have found her—that he was leaving her behind. the day-coach—he was penniless now—was hot. he went out to the open vestibule and sat down on a folding-chair, and the station slid away and the backs of unfamiliar buildings moved by. then out into the spring fields, where a yellow trolley raced them for a minute with people in it who might once have seen
for he gave me a look that i did not understand, and it all passed in a moment. but if he had looked at me for an hour or for a day, i could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having been more attentive. the soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four torches, and took one himself and distributed the others. it had been almost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards very dark. before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in a ring, fired twice into the air. presently we saw other torches kindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the opposite bank of the river. “all right,” said the sergeant. “march.” we had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a sound that seemed to
he had put the offer of the money urged her to speak with harder resolution than ever. “it is of no use, sir. i will not do it. put up your money. i will not touch your money. i will do anything else i can to comfort you; but i will not touch your keys or your money.” “anything else—anything else!” said old featherstone, with hoarse rage, which, as if in a nightmare, tried to be loud, and yet was only just audible. “i want nothing else. you come here—you come here.” mary approached him cautiously, knowing him too well. she saw him dropping his keys and trying to grasp his stick, while he looked at her like an aged hyena, the muscles of his face getting distorted with the effort of his hand. she paused at a safe distance. “let me give you some cordial,” she said, quietly, “and try to compo
the present, sits down at mr. snagsby's table and lays about him prodigiously. the conversion of nutriment of any sort into oil of the quality already mentioned appears to be a process so inseparable from the constitution of this exemplary vessel that in beginning to eat and drink, he may be described as always becoming a kind of considerable oil mills or other large factory for the production of that article on a wholesale scale. on the present evening of the long vacation, in cook's court, cursitor street, he does such a powerful stroke of business that the warehouse appears to be quite full when the works cease. at this period of the entertainment, guster, who has never recovered her first failure, but has neglected no possible or impossible means of bringing the establishment and herse

steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands in his trowsers’ pockets; but perhaps being generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast. nevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say—to seize hold of the nearest oarsman’s hair, and hold on there like grim death. . the town-ho’s story.

go away from the pit, from which he was driven off; he could not even sit down and wait near his mother, he was so deeply stirred by the need to act, which drove him constantly on. it was the third day. négrel, in despair, had resolved to abandon the attempt in the evening. at midday, after lunch, when he came back with his men to make one last effort, he was surprised to see zacharie, red and gesticulating, come out of the mine shouting: she's there! she's replied to me! come along, quickly! he had slid down the ladders, in spite of the watchman, and was declaring that he had heard hammering over there, in the first passage of the guillaume seam. but we have already been twice in that direction, négrel observed, sceptically. anyhow, we'll go and see. maheude had risen, and had
killed by veslovsky alone, and one by both of them together. meanwhile from the other side of the marsh came the sound of stepan arkadyevitch’s shots, not frequent, but, as levin fancied, well-directed, for almost after each they heard “krak, krak, _apporte_!” this excited levin still more. the snipe were floating continually in the air over the reeds. their whirring wings close to the earth, and their harsh cries high in the air, could be heard on all sides; the snipe that had risen first and flown up into the air, settled again before the sportsmen. instead of two hawks there were now dozens of them hovering with shrill cries over the marsh. after walking through the larger half of the marsh, levin and veslovsky reached the place where the peasants’ mowing-grass was divided into long
and myrtle wilson was peering down at the car. so engrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and one emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a slowly developing picture. her expression was curiously familiar—it was an expression i had often seen on women’s faces, but on myrtle wilson’s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until i realized that her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on tom, but on jordan baker, whom she took to be his wife. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ there is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we drove away tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. his wife and his mistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping precipitately
